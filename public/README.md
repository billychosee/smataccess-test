This folder holds public images used by the site (e.g., hero images, thumbnails, icons).

How to use:

- Place image files here and reference them with absolute paths from the app, e.g. `/images/hero.png`.
- Prefer web-optimized formats (WebP/AVIF) and appropriately sized thumbnails.

Examples:

- `/public/images/hero.png` -> use `<Image src="/images/hero.png" ... />` or `<img src="/images/hero.png" />`.

Note: Add real image files (PNG/JPG/WebP) here; this README is a placeholder and a git-friendly way to keep the folder in the repo if empty.
